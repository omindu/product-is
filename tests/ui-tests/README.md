Welcome to WSO2 Identity Server UI tests
========================================


 1. To run these tests, you need to download web drivers from here and extract them and put them in
 their driver folder in a drivers folder in product-is/tests/ui-tests/user-portal/src/test/resources/drivers .
         eg:chrome - chromedriver

    Download Links :
    ----------------
         Chrome : https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.27/chromedriver_linux64.zip

 2. Change the properties in the product-is/tests/ui-tests/user-portal/pom.xml
 to the specific web driver you test.

         Only: Headless and Chrome is available at the moment.
         
         Properties:
                                         <property>
                                             <name>driver</name>
                                             <value>headless</value>
                                         </property>
                                         <property>
                                             <name>pathToChromeDriver</name>
                                             <value>/home/wso2dinali/Downloads/chrome/chromedriver</value>
                                         </property>
                                         
 3. At the moment in order to run these tests, we need to get a WSO2 IS 6.0 pack and run it before running the 
 tests.
